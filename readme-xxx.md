Jaanga Terrain Read Me
======================

![terrain/0/0/0.png]( 0/0/0.png )  
_terrain/0/0/0.png - the entire globe at zoom level 0_

This and the various other related _Jaanga Terrain_ repositories only contain data.
The terrain data is 3D elevation data for the entire globe in the form of PNG heightmaps derived using the data 
from Jonathan de Ferranti's [Viewfinder Panoramas]( http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/ ) web site.

The data may be viewed as maps with a variety of viewers.
Several viewer apps are available from the [_Jaanga Terrain Viewer_]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-viewer/index.html ) repository.

Here's what is on the menu:

## Further Considerations

Aspects and thoughts not covered elsewhere.  This includes discussion on issues/bugs/road map on the current work.

## Thanks

The free open source software movement is wonderful. It's always nice to be able to say 'thank you'.

## Project Links

You have two ways of viewing the Jaanga Terrain files:  

* Code hosted on GitHub: [jaanga.github.io]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain/ "view the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/jaanga]( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain/ "View the files as source code." ) <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>


### System Requirements

In order to view the files on this site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The apps here are currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.

* Too many changes too fast to catalog...

Superseded notes

The current Terrain height maps follow a different projection system than the one used by most Slippy Maps.  We are currently researching the best methods for reconciling the differences.  
  
This repo currently contains every folder and file required to display height maps for Slippy Map levels 0 to 7.  

Currently the folders contain height maps only up to level 7 - After that there is a folder titled 7+ that has...
